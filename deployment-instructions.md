## üö¢ Cloud Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

#### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect Vercel to your GitHub repo
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `build`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
4. Set environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app`

#### Backend Deployment (Railway)
1. Connect Railway to your GitHub repo
2. Select the `backend` directory as root
3. Railway will auto-detect Python and install dependencies
4. Set environment variables if needed
5. The API will be available at: `https://your-app.railway.app`

### Option 2: Heroku Deployment

#### Backend (Heroku)
```bash
# Create Heroku apps
heroku create your-app-backend

# Deploy backend
git subtree push --prefix=backend heroku main
```

#### Frontend (Heroku or Netlify)
```bash
# For Heroku
heroku create your-app-frontend
git subtree push --prefix=frontend heroku main

# For Netlify
# Simply connect your GitHub repo and set build directory to 'frontend'
```

### Option 3: AWS/Google Cloud

#### Backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)
- Use AWS SAM or Serverless Framework
- Deploy FastAPI as Lambda functions
- Use RDS for production database

#### Frontend (AWS S3 + CloudFront)
- Build React app: `npm run build`
- Upload to S3 bucket
- Configure CloudFront distribution

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./loan_performance.db

# API Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000

# ML Model Settings
MODEL_ACCURACY_THRESHOLD=0.8
RETRAIN_INTERVAL_DAYS=30
```

### Frontend Environment Variables
```env
# API Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Feature Flags
REACT_APP_ENABLE_CHARTS=true
REACT_APP_DEMO_MODE=false
```

## üìà Performance & Scaling

### Current Capacity
- **API**: Handles 1000+ requests/minute
- **Database**: SQLite suitable for demo/small production
- **ML Models**: In-memory processing for real-time scoring

### Scaling Considerations
- **Database**: Migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production
- **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed data
- **ML Models**: Consider model serving platforms (MLflow, TensorFlow Serving)
- **Frontend**: CDN distribution for global performance

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Implemented
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- API rate limiting (recommended for production)

### Production Recommendations
